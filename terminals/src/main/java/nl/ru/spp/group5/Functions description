Sandbox for card reader

1. Card Management
initializeCard(): Initializes a new card by setting up its unique ID (IDcard) and loading the symmetric key (Kcard).
issueCard(type, duration): Issues a new card with specified type (season or 10-entry ticket) and duration for season tickets.
rechargeCard(cardId, type): Recharges an existing card identified by cardId with the specified ticket type.
blockCard(cardId): Blocks a card from further use.
unblockCard(cardId): Unblocks a previously blocked card.
checkCardValidity(cardId): Checks whether the card is valid for entry (not blocked, has entries left, or valid season ticket).
updateCardEntries(cardId, entries): Updates the number of entries on a 10-entry ticket card.

2. Vending Machine Operations (Code is now in VendingMachineTerminal)
processCardSale(cardType, duration): Processes the sale of a new card, setting the type (season or 10-entry) and duration for season tickets.
processCardRecharge(cardId, type): Handles the recharging of an existing card.
generateCertificate(cardId, type, duration): Generates a certificate for season tickets, signed with the vending machine's private key.
logTransaction(cardId, transactionType): Logs the transaction details for sales or recharges.

3. Terminal Operations
authenticateCard(cardId): Performs mutual authentication between the card and terminal.
verifyEntry(cardId): Verifies if the card has a valid entry for access.
deductEntry(cardId): Deducts an entry from a 10-entry ticket.
logAccessEvent(cardId, eventType): Logs access events at the terminal.
checkSeasonTicketValidity(cardId): Checks the validity of a season ticket against the current date.

4. Security Protocols
mutualAuthentication(cardId, terminalId): Performs mutual authentication between card and terminal/vending machine.
deriveSessionKey(cardKey, nonce): Derives a session key from the card's symmetric key and a nonce.
generateMAC(message, sessionKey): Generates a Message Authentication Code (MAC) for message integrity and authenticity.
verifyCertificate(cert, publicKey): Verifies the certificate of a season ticket using the public key of the vending machine.
encryptData(data, key): Encrypts data using the given key.
decryptData(data, key): Decrypts data using the given key.

5. Logging and Audit
logEvent(eventType, details): Logs different types of events, such as transactions, access attempts, etc.
auditLogs(): Function to audit logs for irregularities or security breaches.

6. Utility Functions
generateNonce(): Generates a nonce for use in cryptographic protocols.
getCurrentDate(): Retrieves the current date for checking season ticket validity
